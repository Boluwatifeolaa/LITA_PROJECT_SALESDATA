### Project Overview
---
This project analyses sales data from different customers in different region. The aim is to give review into the products sold over different period. To identify the trends, sales overview, top-performing products, and 
regional breakdowns.

### Data Collected
The datase includes the following:
 1. Region : The geographical area where the products is sold
 2. Product : The item been sold
 3. Order Date : The date the product was ordered
 4. Quantity Sold : The Amount of products sold
 5. Order ID: The unique number that is assigned to an item placed by the customer

The project was designed to address the following analysis goals: 
  1. Total Sales by Product : To determine the total sales made by each product
  2. Total Sales by Region : To determine the total sales made in each region
  3. Region by Quantities Sold : To analyse the quantities of products sold in each 
      region
  4. Average Sales by Product : To calculate the average sales per region

### Key Performance Indicator(KPI)

    2. Unit Sold : Sum of units sold, grouped by region and product 
    3. Average Sales : Calculated as Total Sales / Total Unit sold for each region to

### Data Cleaning and Preparations
---
In the initial data preparation phase, the folowing tasks was performed:

- Retrieve the total sales for each product category. 
- Find the number of sales transactions in each region. 
- Find the highest-selling product by total sales value.

This is where we we include some basic lines of code or queries or even some of the DAX expresions used during analysis;

``` SQL
select product,
sum(Revenue) as total_sales
from [dbo].[salesdata]	
group by Product
```

### Results and Findings
---
The analysis results are summarised as follows: 
- Sales Data
   1. The sales revenue made in year 2023 was more than that of year 2024 revenue
   2. Shoes was the highest selling products in terms of sales and revenue
   3. The south region was the region with the high revenue sold, which means customers in other regions should be targeted for 
       marketing efforts
